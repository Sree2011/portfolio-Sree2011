                    <p>
                        Hello! I’m Sree Sai Nandini Gundraju, currently working as a Packaged App Development Associate
                        at
                        Accenture.
                        I’m a dedicated professional with a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering
                        from
                        Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College.
                        <br><br>
                        In my current role, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, honing my skills
                        in
                        C, Java, Python, MATLAB, and Arduino UNO.
                        I’m passionate about leveraging these skills to develop innovative solutions that drive
                        efficiency
                        and effectiveness.
                        <br><br>
                        During my time at college, I served as a Student Coordinator for the Indian Society for
                        Technical
                        Education Student Chapter.
                        This role allowed me to develop strong leadership and coordination skills, which I believe are
                        valuable in any professional setting.
                        <br><br>
                        I’ve also participated in two academic projects and one project from IUCEE Project Based
                        Learning
                        with my team. We were proud to have scored a Grade B in the IUCEE PBL project, a testament to
                        our
                        teamwork and dedication. These experiences have further enriched my technical skills and have
                        given
                        me valuable insights into teamwork and project management.
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, I had the opportunity to participate in a conference conducted by our college.
                        This experience allowed me to engage with the academic community, share ideas, and learn from
                        others
                        in my field.
                        <br><br>
                        My career goal is to connect power systems to the IT world, enabling seamless communication
                        between
                        all the components of a power system. I’m always looking for opportunities to apply my technical
                        skills and my ability to quickly learn new technologies.
                        I’m particularly interested in roles where I can continue to grow within my core industry.
                        <br><br>

                        What motivates me is the ability to see the direct impact of my work on end-users and the
                        opportunity to continuously learn and improve.
                        <br><br>
                        Feel free to connect with me for job opportunities, collaborations, or just to exchange ideas!
